# Module 12 Report Template## Overview of the AnalysisIn this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:The purpose of the machine learning models used in this challenge is to use historical data to accurately predict the creditworthiness of borrowers using a peer-to-peer lending service. This model looked at the dollar amount and interest rates of loans, the income of borrowers, the debt-to-income ratio of borrowers, derogatory marks, and total debt to attempt to predict whether a future borrower's loan status would be 0 (healthy loan) or a 1 (high-risk loan). These models used Logistic Regression, one model using the original data and the other using Oversampled data because the number of healthy loans in the historical data set was significantly greater than the number of high-risk loans. Both models used the model-fit-predict process while being created and ended with an evaluation of the models' success rates. The only major difference between the creation of the two models is that the second (oversampled) model had a "resample" step before "model". ## ResultsUsing bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.* Machine Learning Model 1:  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.		*Accuracy  >  .95205		*Precision  >  '0' = 1.0 , '1' = 0.85 , avg = 0.99		*Recall  >  '0' = 0.99 , '1' = 0.91 , avg = 0.99* Machine Learning Model 2:  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.		*Accuracy  >  .9937		*Precision  >  '0' = 1.0 , '1' = 0.84 , avg = 0.99		*Recall  >  '0' = 0.99 , '1' = 0.99 , avg = 0.99## SummarySummarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )The logistic regression model fit with both the original and oversampled data well. Overall, the model run with oversampled data was better able to predict the healthy and high-risk loan labels. Balanced Accuracy Score: The model using oversampled data had a 99.37% balanced accuracy score. The original model had a 95.20% balanced accuracy score. Therefore, the model with oversampled data was more accurate. Confusion Matrix: Looking at the confusion matrix for the original data, 158 (out of 19384) cases were either false positives or false negatives. However, for the oversampled data, only 120 (out of 19384) were miscategorized by the model. Therefore, the model with oversampled data was more accurate again. Classification Report: The models had almost identical precision. While the models both had the same average recall, the oversampled model had a 0.99 recall for the high-risk category, while the original data got a 0.91 for the high-risk category. Therefore, out of all the data that should've been labeled "high-risk", the oversampled data model was better at accurately categorizing those cases as "high-risk". Lastly, the f1-score of the "high-risk" category in the oversampled model is greater than that of the "high-risk" group in the original data. Because the most important thing is to catch as many high-risk loans as possible, the model using oversampled data is the much better choice. It is better able to accurately predict high-risk loans than the model using the original data. If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
